UIkit Components 8.x-3.x, 06-10-2017 (development version)
-----------------------

Provide separate branches to support both UIkit 2.x.x and 3.x.x library versions
 - In order to support current versions of the UIkit library (v2.x.x and 3.x.x),
   UIkit Components now has different branches to apply the correct theme
   implementations based on the library version.

   * 7.x-2.x/8.x-2.x branches support UIkit 2.x.x
   * 7.x-3.x/8.x-3.x branches support UIkit 3.x.x

   Users will need to install the branch of Uikit Components that supports the
   same UIkit library version of the UIkit theme they have installed. Since many
   of the classes and attributes used by UIkit differ in the two library
   versions, x.x-2.x branches are not compatible with the x.x-3.x branches of
   UIkit Components and the UIkit theme.
